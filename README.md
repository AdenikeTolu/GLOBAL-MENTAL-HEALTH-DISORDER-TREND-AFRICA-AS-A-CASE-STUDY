# GLOBAL-MENTAL-HEALTH-DISORDER-TREND-AFRICA-AS-A-CASE-STUDY
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into mental health disorder trends in Africa, highlighting various mental health conditions, their prevalence, and contributing factors. The analysis is broken down into key metrics, trends, and influencing factors.

1. Key Mental Health Metrics
The dashboard provides high-level statistics on various mental health conditions:

Anxiety Disorder: 1.04M cases

Depression Rate: 146bn

Drug Use Rate: 200K

Eating Disorder Cases: 39K

Schizophrenia Cases: 52K

Suicide Rate: 468K

Bipolar Disorder Cases: 194K

Alcohol Consumption Cases: 370K

These figures indicate a significant mental health burden in Africa, with depression and anxiety disorders being the most prevalent.

2. Suicide and Depression Analysis
The pie chart shows the suicide rate is strongly linked to depression, with suicide rates remaining around 5.73% - 5.74% across different cases.

The line chart on depression prevalence over the years indicates a steady increase in depression cases from 1990 to 2020. This suggests that mental health conditions are becoming more widespread, possibly due to socio-economic changes, increasing awareness, or worsening mental health conditions.

3. Influencing Factors for Depression
The dashboard identifies key demographic and behavioral factors influencing depression:

Higher male population prevalence (>3.5%) leads to a 0.79% increase in depression rates.

Higher female population prevalence (>4.45%) leads to a 0.52% increase.

Alcohol use disorders â‰¤ 0.65% contribute to a 0.49% rise in depression rates.

Drug use disorders (0.51 - 0.57%) contribute to a 0.46% rise.

This suggests that population demographics, substance use, and addiction play a significant role in mental health trends.

4. Regional Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders
The bar chart compares the prevalence of different mental health and substance use disorders across African countries such as:

Lesotho, Equatorial Guinea, Central Africa, Uganda, and Morocco.

Different regions show varying prevalence in alcohol use, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety.

This helps identify high-risk regions where mental health interventions may be necessary.

5. Prevalence by Gender and Country
Countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Egypt are analyzed for gender-based prevalence of mental health disorders.

South Africa and Ethiopia have higher depression prevalence rates (2.8K and 2.5K, respectively).

Gender differences are also visible, indicating a need for gender-specific mental health programs.

Key Takeaways & Recommendations
ðŸ”¹ Rising Depression Cases: Depression rates are increasing significantly, requiring more awareness, mental health policies, and early intervention strategies.
ðŸ”¹ Substance Use and Mental Health: Strong correlation between drug/alcohol use and rising depression rates suggests the need for substance abuse rehabilitation programs.
ðŸ”¹ Gender-Based Differences: Males seem to have a higher impact on depression rates, but both genders require targeted mental health strategies.
ðŸ”¹ Suicide Prevention Measures: The high suicide rate (468K cases) highlights the urgent need for suicide prevention programs, crisis intervention services, and counseling support.
ðŸ”¹ Country-Specific Strategies: Countries with high prevalence rates should develop national mental health frameworks, increase funding, and improve access to mental health services.

Conclusion
This dashboard provides critical insights into Africaâ€™s mental health landscape, helping policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers understand mental health prevalence, risk factors, and regional differences.

By implementing preventative measures, improving access to care, and addressing substance abuse, mental health disorders can be better managed, improving overall well-being in affected populations.
